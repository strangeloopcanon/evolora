# Evolora — Symbiotic LLM Ecology

## Why We’re Doing This (Human-Sized Version)
We want to see whether a colony of tiny LoRA adapters can learn useful behaviour *without* back-propagating through the whole model. Think of the base Gemma-270M host as an ecosystem and each adapter as an organism. They earn “energy” by solving small tasks, spend it on inference, and occasionally merge if they consistently outperform their peers. Our goal is to nudge this colony from random noise to adaptive cooperation, the way life crept out of the Hadean soup into the Cambrian explosion.

## How It Works — in Plain English
1. **Spawn organelles**: we start with a handful of LoRA adapters attached to a frozen Gemma host.
2. **Run tasks**: each generation, organelles tackle math, string, and JSON repair puzzles. Good answers earn credits; bad ones lose energy.
3. **Survive or starve**: energy tickets enforce scarcity. Low-performing organelles run out of fuel and are culled; promising ones accumulate reserves.
4. **Assimilate**: when an organelle keeps winning, we run probes, compare its scores to recent history, and (optionally) merge it with high-ROI neighbours using an SVD-aware LoRA soup.
5. **Log everything**: ROI, energy, assimilation gating reasons, diversity metrics, and holdout verdicts are written to `artifacts_*` directories for later analysis.

If the colony keeps earning more than it spends, the population should drift toward better answers all on its own.

## Architecture Overview (Technical Layer)
- **Host & organelles**: `src/symbiont_ecology/host` wraps the Gemma backbone; `symbiont_ecology/organelles/peft_hebbian.py` implements Hebbian LoRA adapters with reward-modulated updates.
- **Environment**: `symbiont_ecology/environment/grid.py` produces per-cell tasks and prices; `environment/loops.py` orchestrates generations, energy settlement, assimilation, and diversity guardrails.
- **Economics & diversity**: `config/experiments/gemma_relaxed.yaml` encodes tickets, reward bonuses, assimilation knobs, and species energy caps.
- **Telemetry**: episodes land in `artifacts_*/episodes.jsonl`; generation summaries (ROI, gating stats, diversity snapshot) go to `gen_summaries.jsonl`; assimilation events stream into `assimilation.jsonl`.
- **Analysis toolkit**: `scripts/analyze_ecology_run.py` summarises runs, reports ROI volatility, energy Gini/effective population, and shows why assimilation passed or failed.

## Getting Started
1. **Python**: use Python 3.11 (we develop under `.venv311`).
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   python3.11 -m venv .venv311
   source .venv311/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
3. **Optional tooling**: install [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd`) for local issue tracking, and `make` for shortcuts.

## Running the Ecology
- **Smoke test**
  ```bash
  AGENT_MODE=baseline make test VENV=.venv311
  ```
- **Short baseline run**
  ```bash
  MPLCONFIGDIR=$(mktemp -d) \
    AGENT_MODE=baseline .venv311/bin/python scripts/eval_gemma.py \
      --config config/experiments/gemma_relaxed.yaml \
      --generations 10 --batch-size 2 \
      --output artifacts_gemma_smoke
  ```
- **100-generation study**
  ```bash
  MPLCONFIGDIR=$(mktemp -d) \
    AGENT_MODE=baseline .venv311/bin/python scripts/eval_gemma_long.py \
      --config config/experiments/gemma_relaxed.yaml \
      --generations 100 --batch-size 2 \
      --output artifacts_gemma_relaxed_autotune_v5
  ```

## Analysing Results
- Quick summary (no plots):
  ```bash
  MPLCONFIGDIR=$(mktemp -d) \
    .venv311/bin/python scripts/analyze_ecology_run.py \
      artifacts_gemma_relaxed_autotune_v5 --report
  ```
- Report + visuals:
  ```bash
  MPLCONFIGDIR=$(mktemp -d) \
    .venv311/bin/python scripts/analyze_ecology_run.py \
      artifacts_gemma_relaxed_autotune_v5 --plots --report
  ```
The report includes ROI stats, assimilation gating totals, diversity metrics (energy Gini, effective population, species share), and guard decay counters.

## Key Configuration Knobs
- `energy.m`, `energy.cost_scale`: ticket price and cost damping.
- `environment.success_reward_bonus`, `environment.failure_cost_multiplier`: steer survival pressure.
- `assimilation_tuning.*`: guard baselines, probe requirements, holdout settings, and LoRA soup behaviour.
- `diversity.*`: energy Gini cap and per-species share limit.

Tweak `config/experiments/gemma_relaxed.yaml`, rerun the long evaluation, and compare `gen_summaries.jsonl` across artifacts.

## Repo Layout
```
src/                 core code (host, environment, evolution, metrics)
scripts/             CLI automation (bootstrap, eval, analysis)
config/              experiment YAMLs and holdout tasks
tests/               pytest suite (economics, morphogenesis, assimilation)
tests_llm_live/      placeholder for live LLM golden tests
artifacts_*/         run outputs (gitignored telemetry & plots)
WORK_LOG.md          running notes for long experiments
```

## Development Workflow
1. Track work with Beads (`bd create`, `bd list`) — issues live under `.beads/` (gitignored).
2. Make changes in a feature branch, keep commits Conventional Commit style (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`...).
3. Run the fast gates locally: `make test` (includes pytest) and optionally lint via `ruff`/`black`.
4. For long experiments, append a short entry to `WORK_LOG.md` with command, config, and summary.
5. Analyse runs with the analysis script and stash artefacts under the gitignored `artifacts_*` directories.

## Current Focus / Next Experiments
- **Assimilation success**: we see high ROI but merges still fail. Next steps are to enlarge score history, revisit uplift thresholds, and fine-tune holdout requirements.
- **Skill metrics**: evaluation accuracy remains 0/60. Consider curriculum changes or additional task families.
- **Human bandit calibration**: sweep `preference_weight`, `helper_weight`, and `frequency` once the ecology stabilises; watch the impact on ROI volatility.
- **Telemetry dashboards**: the data already exists in `gen_summaries.jsonl` — wiring a live dashboard is the natural follow-up.

## Contributing
Pull requests welcome! Please:
- open an issue (or `bd create`) before large feature work,
- keep gitignored paths (artifacts, virtualenvs, caches) out of commits,
- run the full test suite (`AGENT_MODE=baseline make test VENV=.venv311`),
- run the survival regression (`tests/test_survival_resilience.py`) after touching economics,
- include analysis notes or updated documentation when behaviour changes.

Happy evolving — let’s see if this Cambrian-era colony learns something genuinely new.
