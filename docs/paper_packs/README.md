# Paper Packs

This folder contains small, tracked “paper packs”: summary tables plus curated plots copied out of
gitignored `artifacts_*` run directories.

- `paper_qwen3_20251215/README.md` — Qwen3‑0.6B paper-suite baselines (frozen vs single vs ecology).

To generate a new pack from your own run directories, use `scripts/paper_pack.py`.
